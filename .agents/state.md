# KAIROS OS State

## Current Status
- **Backend (Next.js Proxy)**: Implemented authentication logic and Supabase DAOs for proxying requests.
- **Android App**: 
  - Integrated Supabase Auth (`supabase-kt` 3.6.0).
  - Resolved Gradle/Hilt/Kotlin metadata compatibility hell by migrating to KSP 2.3.9 natively on AGP 9.0.0 and Gradle 9.1.0, paired with Hilt 2.60.
  - Successfully compiled `assembleDebug` with Hilt generation successfully working.
  - `LoginScreen` and `AuthViewModel` configured.

## Next Steps
- Implement end-to-end testing between the Android Auth flow, proxy server, and Supabase cloud.
- Address any further UI/UX requirements for the Login screen.
- Continue implementing the rest of the OS architecture.
